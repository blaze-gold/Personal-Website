## Overview

Propy is a blockchain platform that makes real estate transactions secure and efficient. As a full-stack engineer, I helped build features for secure property transfers using blockchain, and worked on both the frontend and backend to improve the user experience and platform performance.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain-Enabled Transactions**: Utilized blockchain technology to enable secure, transparent property transfers and smart contract management.
- **Real-Time Property Listings**: Integrated real-time property listing updates, ensuring users have access to the latest available properties.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed an intuitive UI that streamlines the property buying and selling process for both buyers and sellers.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built a robust backend system to efficiently handle high volumes of transactions and user activity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Web3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, GraphQL
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- *Database & Version Control**: MongoDB, Git, GitHub, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx
## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was integrating blockchain technology with the real estate platform to ensure secure transactions while maintaining system performance. I gained valuable experience working with Ethereum smart contracts and optimizing the backend to handle high transaction volumes. Additionally, I strengthened my skills in cross-functional collaboration and cloud infrastructure to ensure seamless deployment and scalability.

## Outcome

The Propy platform successfully integrated blockchain technology to enable secure, transparent property transactions, improving trust and efficiency in the real estate process. The backend optimizations and UI enhancements contributed to a smoother user experience, supporting high transaction volumes and ensuring scalability for future growth.
